# JSON Uppercase Keys

Read a JSON file located at `/app/input.txt` containing a JSON object.

Transform the JSON by converting all keys to uppercase while keeping values unchanged.

Write the transformed JSON to `/app/output.txt`.

Example:
- Input: `{"name": "Meghana", "age": 21}`
- Output: `{"NAME": "Meghana", "AGE": 21}`
